## Reverse String

This question is asked by Google. Given a string, reverse all of its characters and return the resulting string.

Ex: Given the following strings...

```
“Cat”, return “taC”
“The Daily Byte”, return "etyB yliaD ehT”
“civic”, return “civic”
```

## Valid Palindrome

This question is asked by Facebook. Given a string, return whether or not it forms a palindrome ignoring case and non-alphabetical characters.
Note: a palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.

Ex: Given the following strings...

```
"level", return true
"algorithm", return false
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama.", return true
```

## Vacuum Cleaner Route

This question is asked by Amazon. Given a string representing the sequence of moves a robot vacuum makes, return whether or not it will return to its original position. The string will only contain `L`, `R`, `U`, and `D` characters, representing left, right, up, and down respectively.

Ex: Given the following strings...

```
"LR", return true
"URURD", return false
"RUULLDRD", return true
```

## Correct Capitalization

This question is asked by Google. Given a string, return whether or not it uses capitalization correctly. A string correctly uses capitalization if all letters are capitalized, no letters are capitalized, or only the first letter is capitalized.

Ex: Given the following strings...

```
"USA", return true
"Calvin", return true
"compUter", return false
"coding", return true
```

## Add Binary

This question is asked by Apple. Given two binary strings (strings containing only 1s and 0s) return their sum (also as a binary string).

Note: neither binary string will contain leading 0s unless the string itself is 0

Ex: Given the following binary strings...

```
"100" + "1", return "101"
"11" + "1", return "100"
"1" + "0", return  "1"
```

## Longest Common Prefix

This question is asked by Microsoft. Given an array of strings, return the longest common prefix that is shared amongst all strings.
Note: you may assume all strings only contain lowercase alphabetical characters.

Ex: Given the following arrays...

```
["colorado", "color", "cold"], return "col"
["a", "b", "c"], return ""
["spot", "spotty", "spotted"], return "spot"
```

## Valid Palindrome with Removal

This question is asked by Facebook. Given a string and the ability to delete at most one character, return whether or not it can form a palindrome.
Note: a palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.

Ex: Given the following strings...

```
"abcba", return true
"foobof", return true (remove the first 'o', the second 'o', or 'b')
"abccab", return false
```

## Two Sum

This question is asked by Google. Given an array of integers, return whether or not two numbers sum to a given target, `k`.
Note: you may not sum a number with itself.

Ex: Given the following...

```
[1, 3, 8, 2], k = 10, return true (8 + 2)
[3, 9, 13, 7], k = 8, return false
[4, 2, 6, 5, 2], k = 4, return true (2 + 2)
```
